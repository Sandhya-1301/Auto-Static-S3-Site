# AUTO-STATIC-S3-SITE 🚀

This project showcases a fully automated static website using CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions and hosted on AWS S3. Designed as part of my MCA learning journey, it demonstrates cloud-native deployment techniques with clean architecture, live time/date updates, and quality-driven workflows.

## ✨ Features

- Static website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for linting and deployment  
- HTMLHint integration to ensure markup quality  
- Real-time display of current time and formatted date using JavaScript  
- Visual architecture diagram to illustrate deployment flow

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (`.yml` workflows)  
- Linting: HTMLHint (`.htmlhintrc`)  
- Hosting: AWS S3 (Static Website Hosting)

## 🌐 Live Site

Hosted on AWS S3 with public access:  
`http://auto-static-s3-site.s3-website-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com`  
*(URL will be active once the bucket is created and deployment is successful)*

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with GitHub Actions and `.yml` automation  
- Learned to enforce HTML quality using linting tools  
- Built a modular, visually appealing site with deploy-on-push capability  
- Applied structured DevOps practices to real-world project flows

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m **Pilla Sandhya Rani**, currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) with a focus on cloud computing, DevOps, and web automation. This project is part of my academic exploration into modern deployment workflows using GitHub Actions and AWS S3.

My goal is to build elegant, functional web solutions that are not only visually effective but also technically robust and scalable. Through this project, I’m learning how automation streamlines software delivery — turning simple static sites into continuously deployed cloud experiences.

I’m passionate about:
- Designing clean, responsive UIs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Exploring CI/CD pipelines to automate deployments  
- Expanding my knowledge in cloud-native tools and DevOps practices

This repository reflects both my learning progress and my commitment to building meaningful, deployable software as part of my academic and professional growth.
